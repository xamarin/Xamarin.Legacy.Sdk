# Xamarin.Legacy.Sdk

An unofficial MSBuild SDK for multitargeting "legacy" Xamarin and .NET 6. _Not fully supported._

This allows you to create a class library such as:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Xamarin.Legacy.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>monoandroid11.0;xamarin.ios10;net6.0-android;net6.0-ios</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

You will also need either include a `global.json` with:

```json
{
  "msbuild-sdks": {
    "Xamarin.Legacy.Sdk": "0.1.0-alpha1"
  }
}
```

Or specify the version inline:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Xamarin.Legacy.Sdk/0.1.0-alpha1">
```

To setup a binding project instead of a class library, simply set
`<IsBindingProject>true</IsBindingProject>` in your `.csproj` file.

## Samples

* `Hello`: a simple class library targeting Xamarin.iOS,
  Xamarin.Android, and .NET 6
* `JavaBinding`: a Xamarin.Android binding for
  [com.google.code.gson][gson] based off of the
  [GoogleGson][xamaringson] Xamarin component.

[gson]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.5
[xamaringson]: https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents/tree/master/Android/GoogleGson/source/GoogleGson

## Installation requirements

You will need:

* At least Visual Studio 2019 16.9 or higher.
* Xamarin.Android from the Visual Studio installer.
* .NET 6 SDKs and any other dependencies as described [here][net6-samples].

## Notes for Windows

`dotnet build` command-line with .NET 6 will have a new enough MSBuild for this to work.

Otherwise, you will at least need Visual Studio 2019 16.9 which is currently in preview to use:

```cmd
> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" -version
```

You will also need to enable a feature-flag to enable .NET 6 workloads. In an administrator command prompt:

```cmd
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Preview\MSBuild\Current\Bin\SdkResolvers\Microsoft.DotNet.MSBuildSdkResolver"
echo > EnableWorkloadResolver.sentinel
```

This will create an empty file.

### Microsoft.Android.Sdk not installed

If you hit the error:

```
The following workload packs were not installed: Microsoft.Android.Sdk
```

Temporarily, you can make a symbolic link to workaround this. In an administrator command prompt:

```cmd
> mklink /J "C:\Program Files\dotnet\packs\Microsoft.Android.Sdk" "C:\Program Files\dotnet\packs\Microsoft.Android.Sdk.win-x64"
Junction created for C:\Program Files\dotnet\packs\Microsoft.Android.Sdk <<===>> C:\Program Files\dotnet\packs\Microsoft.Android.Sdk.win-x64
```

This workaround should no longer be needed when the MSBuild shipped in Visual Studio is updated.

## Notes for macOS

The version of MSBuild shipped with Mono & VS for Mac is not currently new enough to build .NET 6 projects. For now, you will need to use `dotnet build` at the command-line.

If you hit the error:

```
error : /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/6.0.100-alpha.1.20562.2/Sdks/Microsoft.Android.Sdk/Sdk not found. Check that a recent enough .NET SDK is installed and/or increase the version specified in global.json.
```

Verify you are using `dotnet build` have the required [.NET 6][net6-samples] packages installed.

### libMonoPosixHelper.dylib

If you hit the error:

```
error XACML7000: System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load shared library 'MonoPosixHelper' or one of its dependencies.
In order to help diagnose loading problems, consider setting the DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES environment variable: dlopen(libMonoPosixHelper, 1): image not found 
```

A temporary workaround would be:

```bash
$ cd /Library/Frameworks/Xamarin.Android.framework/Versions/Current/lib/xbuild/Xamarin/Android/lib/host-Darwin/
$ sudo cp libMonoPosixHelper.dylib ../../
```

This simply copies `libMonoPosixHelper.dylib` to an additional location so it can be loaded when running under .NET 6.
